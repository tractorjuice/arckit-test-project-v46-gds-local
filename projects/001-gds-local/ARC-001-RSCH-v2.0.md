## Executive Summary

### Research Scope

This research document covers six thematic areas of business intelligence relevant to the GDS Local programme:

1. GDS Local programme facts and official context
2. Local authority landscape — structure, numbers, finances, and digital maturity
3. Existing government digital programmes for local government
4. Local government technology market context
5. Policy and regulatory environment
6. Comparable international programmes

### Key Findings

- **Programme scale**: GDS Local was formally launched on 22 November 2025, building on engagement with over 300 digital professionals across local councils. The programme operates within DSIT/GDS and targets England's 317 local authorities (as at 2024, subject to reorganisation).
- **Fiscal crisis is acute**: Eight councils have issued Section 114 notices since 2018 (compared to two in the preceding 30 years). 29 councils required Exceptional Financial Support in 2025-26, up from 8 in 2023-24. The local government funding gap is forecast at £7.4 billion cumulatively 2026-2028. This creates both urgency and receptiveness for cost-saving shared platforms.
- **Significant productivity opportunity**: The State of Digital Government Review (January 2025) identified £45 billion per year of unrealised productivity benefits across the public sector, with local government being a substantial contributor. Local government spends only 4.9% of operating expenses on digital and data — well below the 7% benchmark.
- **Digital maturity is highly variable**: Only about half of councils have a published digital strategy; only one council in surveys described providing digital skills training "in full." Most councils are resource-constrained, with small IT teams managing commodity technology.
- **GOV.UK OneLogin timeline extended**: The full delivery date for GOV.UK OneLogin has slipped to 2028, with an additional £115 million budget committed for 2025-26. The local government discovery (conducted with 14 councils, 8 suppliers, 36 survey respondents) identified cost savings and identity verification as top priorities — but also raised digital exclusion and resident trust as key barriers.
- **Reorganisation adds complexity**: England is undergoing major local government reorganisation (LGR) to merge two-tier county and district councils into unitary authorities. This affects the number and structure of councils GDS Local will engage with, creating both opportunity (new organisations wanting modern digital infrastructure) and disruption (councils absorbed with restructuring).
- **Supplier market is concentrated**: Civica leads council procurement deals (16 in recent analysis), followed by Phoenix Software, The Access Group, and Idox. The top 4-5 suppliers hold significant market share across line-of-business systems. Council spend with large tech suppliers reached £1.9 billion in 2023-24.

## Part 1: GDS Local Programme Facts

### 1.1 What is GDS Local?

GDS Local is a specialist unit within the Government Digital Service (GDS), which sits within the Department for Science, Innovation and Technology (DSIT). It was formally launched on 22 November 2025, following engagement with over 300 local government digital professionals between January and April 2025.

The unit is described on GOV.UK as working "with and alongside local government to deliver the ambitions set out in the blueprint for a modern digital government." It "brings central and local government together to improve how digital public services are designed and delivered."

**Source**: [GDS Local goes live — GDS Blog, 24 November 2025](https://gds.blog.gov.uk/2025/11/24/gds-local-goes-live/)

### 1.2 Leadership

| Role | Name |
|------|------|
| Service Owner | Liz Adams |
| Local Government Champion | Theo Blackwell |

Theo Blackwell is also the Chief Digital Officer for London, providing an important link between GDS Local and the London Borough councils.

### 1.3 Three Strategic Focus Areas

The GOV.UK guidance page for GDS Local sets out three focus areas:

**Focus Area 1: Technology Vision**
Co-creating a technology vision for local government with MHCLG, LGA, and council practitioners; developing shared technology products and components; establishing a "new, joined-up approach to buying and IT market reform." This addresses the problem of 333+ councils individually procuring commodity technology.

**Focus Area 2: Data Access Improvement**
Breaking down barriers to data sharing across local services so teams can access data needed to make decisions, identify trends, and demonstrate impact. The announcement specifically referenced the Government Digital and Data Hub as a simultaneous initiative. An early use case hackathon focused on homelessness and temporary accommodation (November 2025, Birmingham).

**Focus Area 3: GDS Product Availability**
Making more GDS products and platforms actively available to local authorities, specifically GOV.UK App and GOV.UK OneLogin. The stated aspiration is that residents could "use a single sign-on and identity verification service to access both central and local government services, dramatically reducing form-filling and repeat verification."

### 1.4 Policy Context

GDS Local was announced in the context of two major policy publications released on 21 January 2025:

1. **State of Digital Government Review**: An assessment of the current state of UK digital government, finding £45 billion per year of unrealised productivity benefits across the public sector.

2. **Blueprint for a Modern Digital Government**: A long-term vision for digital public services including a 6-point plan for reform. The blueprint explicitly included plans to "define new models for collaboration" with local government and the NHS, "potentially sharing technological solutions."

The blueprint also announced the creation of the expanded digital centre within DSIT, unifying GDS, CDDO, i.AI, the Geospatial Commission, and parts of the Responsible Tech Adoption Unit.

### 1.5 Contact and Engagement

- Primary contact: GDSLocal-info@dsit.gov.uk
- The programme set up early pathfinder/pilot activities, including hackathons with Liverpool City Region cited as an early partnership example.

## Part 2: Local Authority Landscape

### 2.1 Structure of Local Government in England

England's local government structure is complex and multi-tiered, reflecting historical development rather than a rational design. As of 2024, England has **317 local authorities** distributed across the following types:

| Type | Count | Notes |
|------|-------|-------|
| County councils | 21 | Upper tier in two-tier areas |
| District councils | 164 | Lower tier in two-tier areas |
| Metropolitan district councils | 36 | Single tier (e.g., Birmingham, Manchester) |
| London borough councils | 32 | Single tier within Greater London |
| Unitary authorities | 62 | Single tier outside London/metropolitan areas |
| Sui generis | 2 | City of London Corporation; Council of Isles of Scilly |
| **Total** | **317** | Subject to ongoing reorganisation |

**Note on the 333 figure**: The programme documents reference "333 councils" — this includes two-tier areas where both the county council and each district council are counted as separate entities with separate procurement and IT functions. The distinction matters operationally: the 185 councils in two-tier areas (21 county + 164 district) often duplicate technology for shared local populations.

**Source**: [Local government in England — Wikipedia, citing ONS and Parliament research](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_government_in_England)

### 2.2 Population Served

- Total population of England: approximately 56 million
- Average population per local authority: approximately 177,000
- Range: City of London (~9,000 residents) to Birmingham (~1.1 million)
- London boroughs typically serve 150,000–350,000 residents each

### 2.3 Local Government Reorganisation (LGR)

A major structural reform is underway. In December 2024, the government announced plans to reorganise England's two-tier county and district councils into unitary authorities as part of the English Devolution White Paper. This is the largest restructuring of English local government in decades.

**Key LGR facts**:
- Government invited all 21 two-tier areas and some others to submit reorganisation proposals
- Up to 164 district councils (and 21 county councils) could be merged into a smaller number of unitaries
- Surrey: 12 existing councils to become 2 unitaries (East Surrey and West Surrey) — elections May 2026, live April 2027
- Mayoral Combined Authorities being established in parallel (e.g., West of England, Lancashire, Cheshire & Warrington)
- 29 out of 63 invited councils had local elections postponed (January 2026 confirmation)
- £7.6 million made available for reorganisation proposal development

**Implication for GDS Local**: As councils reorganise, successor unitary authorities will be establishing new technology strategies. GDS Local has an opportunity to engage with these new organisations at the point of inception — but also risks competing for attention with reorganisation work. Reorganisation will reduce the total number of councils, changing the scale of GDS Local's potential market.

### 2.4 Local Government Finances

Local government in England is experiencing its most severe sustained financial crisis since austerity began in 2010. Key facts:

**Funding gap and pressures**:
- Cumulative funding gap forecast at £7.4 billion over 2026-2028 (UNISON/LGA estimates)
- 2026-27 funding gap alone: £4.1 billion across England
- London boroughs: projected £4 billion cumulative funding gap 2025-2029

**Section 114 notices** (statutory declarations that a council cannot balance its budget):
- Only 2 Section 114 notices in 30 years before 2018
- 8 local authorities, 12 Section 114 notices since 2018
- Highest-profile: Birmingham City Council (September 2023) — attributed to equal pay liabilities, IT system failures (an Oracle ERP implementation), and £1 billion in government cuts over 10 years

**Exceptional Financial Support**:
- 8 councils needed EFS in 2023-24
- 19 councils needed EFS in 2024-25
- 29 councils needed EFS in 2025-26

**Annual spending**:
- Local government (England): approximately £5 billion annual technology spend (State of Digital Government Review)
- Direct spend with large tech suppliers: £1.9 billion in 2023-24
- Real-terms budget reductions since 2010 have been substantial, with adult social care absorbing growing proportions of shrinking budgets

### 2.5 Digital Maturity

Digital maturity across England's councils varies enormously. Evidence from the Local Digital Fund's Digital and Cyber Maturity Survey (Summer 2023 baseline, covering 71 responding councils):

| Indicator | Finding |
|-----------|---------|
| Councils with an identified technology leader | 72% (51 out of 71) |
| Councils with a published digital strategy | 53% (37 out of 70) |
| Councils equipping staff with digital skills to some extent | 86% (61 out of 71) |
| Councils providing digital skills training "in full" | 1 out of 71 (1.4%) |
| Councils with an open culture valuing digital ways of working | 55% (39 out of 71) |
| Staff who completed digital skills training offered | Average of one-third |

**Digital spend**:
- Local government spends 4.9% of operating expenses on digital and data
- Benchmark (comparable organisations): 7%
- Digital/data spend per FTE: 78% below peer benchmarks

**Key challenges identified** (from Future Councils Pilot, MHCLG, April 2024):
- Small IT teams (10-50 staff for most councils) managing large, diverse technology estates
- Vendor lock-in: long-term contracts with limited flexibility for change
- Digital skills gaps at both technical and leadership levels
- Legacy systems that resist integration
- Limited capacity for innovation alongside BAU maintenance
- Change fatigue: multiple central initiatives competing for council attention

## Part 3: Existing Government Digital Programmes for Local Government

### 3.1 Local Digital Programme (MHCLG)

The Local Digital programme (originally MHCLG, continuing under the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government) is the most directly relevant predecessor and parallel initiative to GDS Local.

**Origins**: The Local Digital Fund was launched in December 2018 (Rishi Sunak as Local Government Minister). Its stated aims were to help local authorities "break their dependence on inflexible technology, adopt the best digital ways of working, and ultimately offer excellent local services for less."

**Funding rounds and scale**:
| Round | Date | Amount | Projects |
|-------|------|--------|---------|
| Round 1 | December 2018 | £1,251,492 | 16 projects |
| Round 2 | August 2019 | £753,095 | 6 projects |
| Round 3 | September 2019 | £524,300 | 7 projects |
| Round 4 | March 2020 | £1,200,000 | 6 projects |
| COVID-19 | July 2020 | £800,000 | 11 projects |
| Round 6 | October 2022 | £2,016,325 | 17 projects |
| **Total (all rounds)** | 2018-2022 | **~£16M+** | 61+ projects |

**As of 2024**: No further funding through the Local Digital Fund model is planned. The programme evaluation (commissioned 2023, running to 2025) is assessing outcomes.

**Local Digital Declaration**: Over 300 local authorities and supporting organisations have committed to improving services through the declaration's principles (share, collaborate, reuse; meet user needs; be open by default; etc.).

**Key lesson for GDS Local**: The Local Digital programme worked well for innovation experiments but did not achieve systemic change. Funding was modest, competitive (not universal), and the collaborative project model requires sustained effort from recipient councils. GDS Local represents a shift to a more infrastructure-focused, platform-oriented model.

**Sources**: [Local Digital Fund — localdigital.gov.uk](https://www.localdigital.gov.uk/fund/); [Measuring the impact — localdigital.gov.uk](https://www.localdigital.gov.uk/programme-evaluation/)

### 3.2 Digital Planning Programme (MHCLG)

A more recent MHCLG initiative focused specifically on planning as a domain for digital transformation.

**Key facts**:
- 43 Local Planning Authorities joined the Open Digital Planning community by 2024
- One pilot achieved a 119% increase in citizen participation in planning
- Pilot projects saved 280 hours of planning officer time
- 2024 review noted continued progress with data publication and API development

This represents a successful, targeted use of digital funding in a specific policy domain — a model GDS Local's data sharing pilots (planning-transport) might follow.

**Source**: [Digital Planning Programme: our year in review — MHCLG Digital, December 2024](https://mhclgdigital.blog.gov.uk/2024/12/19/digital-planning-programme-our-year-in-review/)

### 3.3 GOV.UK Notify — Local Government Adoption

**What it is**: A government notification service allowing organisations to send emails, text messages, and letters to users. Free for public sector use.

**Local government adoption** (best available data):
- Over 1,500 services using GOV.UK Notify across the public sector (reported 2019; current figure likely significantly higher)
- "More than half of all councils in the UK now use GOV.UK Notify" (GOV.UK Notify website)
- Types of use: flood warnings, appointment reminders, council tax reminders, bin collection alerts, planning application updates

**Implication**: GOV.UK Notify is already the most widely adopted GDS platform in local government. It represents a proven pathway for GDS Local — councils already familiar with Notify are more likely to adopt additional GDS platforms (OneLogin, Pay, Forms).

**Sources**: [GOV.UK Notify — over 1,500 services, GDS Blog 2019](https://gds.blog.gov.uk/2019/12/20/gov-uk-notify-is-sending-messages-for-more-than-1500-services-across-the-public-sector/); [How GOV.UK Notify helps local authorities, GDS Blog 2019](https://gds.blog.gov.uk/2019/05/20/how-gov-uk-notify-is-helping-local-authorities-improve-their-services/)

### 3.4 GOV.UK Pay — Local Government

**What it is**: A government payment platform allowing public sector organisations to take card payments online. Free to integrate; transaction fees apply (approximately 1.5%).

**Local government adoption**: GOV.UK Pay is open to local authorities for payments such as council tax, planning fees, and parking permits. Integration with existing council systems (particularly Civica, Capita, and others) has been a barrier.

**Implication for GDS Local**: The programme should build on existing Notify and Pay adoption to demonstrate a credible "shared platform" value proposition. Councils already using one GDS platform are easier to engage for additional platforms.

### 3.5 GOV.UK OneLogin — Local Government Discovery

OneLogin is the government's single sign-on and identity verification platform, primarily serving central government departments. Extending it to local government is one of GDS Local's most visible commitments.

**Discovery research findings** (published September 2025):
- Research conducted with 14 councils, 8 suppliers, and 36 survey respondents
- Council priorities: cost savings, enhanced identity verification, reducing manual processes
- Strategic value identified: "building digital infrastructure for integrated local-central government services"
- Key barriers: digital exclusion, resident trust, transitioning users from existing systems
- Councils warned that delayed rollout could conflict with solutions they are already developing independently

**Timeline complications**:
- GOV.UK OneLogin full delivery date has been revised to 2028 (previously 2025)
- £115 million committed for 2025-26 alone
- MHCLG discovery work on GOV.UK One Login for local government was in progress as of the GDS Local launch (November 2025)
- "Government eyes full adoption of GOV.UK One Login by 2027" (central government services)

**Implication for GDS Local**: The programme's Q3 2026 target for local authority federation with OneLogin is ambitious given the platform's own delivery trajectory. The discovery research confirms councils want it, but implementation timing requires careful coordination with the OneLogin team.

**Sources**: [Key learnings from GOV.UK One Login discovery — Local Digital](https://www.localdigital.gov.uk/news/key-learnings-from-gov-uk-one-login-discovery-research-for-local-government/); [MHCLG discovery blog, April 2025](https://mhclgdigital.blog.gov.uk/2025/04/23/exploring-approaches-for-using-gov-uk-one-login-in-local-government-join-our-discovery/); [OneLogin delivery date revised — Public Technology, August 2025](https://www.publictechnology.net/2025/08/01/science-technology-and-research/excl-one-login-delivery-date-revised-to-2028-with-hundreds-of-millions-of-extra-spending-set-to-be-committed/)

### 3.6 Government Digital and Data Hub

Launched simultaneously with GDS Local (November 2025), the Government Digital and Data Hub offers training, career guidance, and networking for public sector digital professionals across central government, local councils, NHS, and other public bodies.

This is relevant to GDS Local's community of practice goal — the Hub provides a ready-made cross-sector digital community platform.

## Part 4: Local Government Technology Market

### 4.1 Market Size and Spending

| Metric | Value | Source |
|--------|-------|--------|
| Annual local government technology spend (England) | ~£5 billion | State of Digital Government Review 2025 |
| Direct spend with large tech suppliers (2023-24) | £1.9 billion | Computer Weekly, 2024 |
| Total public sector technology spend | ~£26 billion/year | State of Digital Government Review 2025 |
| Top 30 councils' combined supplier spend (2024) | £6.9 billion | Stotles, 2025 |
| 30 councils receiving emergency funding (2025) | £1.3 billion | Stotles analysis, 2025 |

### 4.2 Key Suppliers

Local government technology is dominated by a small number of specialist suppliers that provide line-of-business systems (housing management, social care, revenues and benefits, planning, etc.):

| Supplier | Specialisation | Notable Facts |
|----------|----------------|---------------|
| **Civica** | Housing, revenues, benefits, libraries, HR | Most council procurement deals (16 in recent analysis); turnover £511M (FY Sept 2023); 74% UK revenue; sold by Partners Group (2024) |
| **Capita** | Revenues, benefits, waste, HR, contact centres | Significant council outsourcing contracts; financial difficulties in recent years |
| **NEC Software Solutions** (formerly Northgate) | Revenues, benefits, housing | Major player in revenues and benefits |
| **Idox** | Planning, land and property, regulatory services | 6 recent council deals; specialist in planning systems |
| **The Access Group** | Social care, HR, finance | 7 recent council deals; growing through acquisition |
| **Phoenix Software** | IT procurement, Microsoft licensing | 8 recent council deals; IT value-added reseller |
| **Agilisys** | Digital transformation, technology services | Major council ICT outsourcing contracts |
| **Mitel / Unify / BT** | Communications infrastructure | Council telephony and contact centres |

**Market dynamics**:
- Suppliers typically hold 5-10 year contracts with councils, creating high switching costs
- Many contracts were signed before cloud-native alternatives existed
- Birmingham's Oracle ERP failure (contributing to its Section 114 notice) illustrates the risk of large, monolithic IT programmes in councils
- Suppliers are watching GDS Local carefully — horizontal commodity capabilities (identity, notifications, payments) could displace elements of their existing offerings

### 4.3 Procurement Approaches

Council technology procurement typically follows one of several routes:
- **Crown Commercial Service frameworks**: G-Cloud (cloud services), Digital Outcomes and Specialists (digital delivery), Technology Products (hardware/software)
- **Local authority-specific frameworks**: Eastern Shires Purchasing Organisation (ESPO), YPO, NEUPC
- **Direct procurement**: Tender via Contracts Finder or Find a Tender for contracts above OJEU threshold (£213,477 for local government)
- **Consortium purchasing**: Some councils jointly procure, particularly for infrastructure

**Procurement challenge**: Most council procurement officers lack specialist digital/technology expertise. Many commodity procurements are over-specified and over-negotiated, contributing to higher costs and vendor lock-in.

### 4.4 LGA Digital Initiatives

The Local Government Association has its own digital programmes:
- **Digital Council programme**: Supporting councils to use technology more effectively
- **LGA Digital conference**: Annual sector event
- **Cyber Security guidance**: Published best practice for councils
- **AI guidance for local government**: LGA and MHCLG piloted a leadership programme for senior officers in non-digital roles to build AI confidence (reported early 2025)

**Source**: [LGA launches framework for digital transformation — LocalGov](https://www.localgov.co.uk/LGA-launches-framework-for-digital-transformation/60767)

## Part 5: Policy and Regulatory Context

### 5.1 DSIT and the Digital Centre

GDS Local operates within DSIT (Department for Science, Innovation and Technology), which assumed responsibility for the digital centre of government following the creation of this department. The expanded GDS now incorporates:
- Government Digital Service (GDS)
- Central Digital and Data Office (CDDO)
- Incubator for Artificial Intelligence (i.AI)
- Geospatial Commission (parts)
- Responsible Tech Adoption Unit (parts)

GDS publishes a January 2026 roadmap for modern digital government setting out priorities for the year ahead, of which GDS Local is one component.

**Source**: [Our roadmap for modern digital government — GDS Blog, January 2026](https://gds.blog.gov.uk/2026/01/20/our-roadmap-for-modern-digital-government/)

### 5.2 MHCLG Local Government Policy

MHCLG is the policy department for local government in England. Key relevant policies:
- **English Devolution White Paper** (December 2024): Announced LGR programme; mayoral combined authorities expansion; shift towards more strategic local governance
- **Local government funding formula**: Subject to fair funding review and reset — new formula announced in October 2025 settlement
- **£64 billion funding package**: Government confirmed the 2025-26 local government finance settlement, with significant redistribution toward urban and more deprived areas
- **Data sharing powers**: MHCLG has interest in improving data flows from councils for housing, planning, and social care policy purposes

### 5.3 Data Sharing Legislation and Powers

The legal basis for cross-service data sharing is a key concern for GDS Local (requirement BR-002):

**Existing powers**:
- **Digital Economy Act 2017** (Part 5): Established public service delivery data sharing powers; created legal gateways for specific data sharing arrangements between public authorities
- **UK GDPR and Data Protection Act 2018**: Requires lawful basis, purpose limitation, data minimisation, DPIAs for high-risk processing
- **Health and Social Care Act 2012**: NHS data sharing provisions
- **Care Act 2014**: Adult social care duties, including assessment and information sharing obligations

**Key legislative gap**: There is no general power for local authorities to share data between services. Each sharing arrangement requires its own lawful basis, Data Sharing Agreement, and (typically) DPIA. This creates significant legal overhead for multi-authority data sharing, supporting the case for a GDS Local data sharing framework with template DSAs and ICO endorsement.

**ICO regulatory approach**: The ICO has positioned itself as an enabler of responsible data sharing, publishing codes of practice and supporting regulatory sandboxes for innovative approaches. The ICO's "data sharing code of practice" (updated 2021) provides a framework for public authorities.

### 5.4 Mandatory API Publication

The Blueprint for Modern Digital Government announced that "rules making it mandatory for every public sector organisation to publish its application programme interfaces (APIs)" are being developed. This directly supports GDS Local's API gateway and data sharing ambitions — if councils are required to expose APIs, integration becomes technically easier.

### 5.5 Technology Code of Practice (TCoP)

The TCoP applies to all significant government technology spend. Points most relevant to GDS Local:
- **Point 1**: Define user needs
- **Point 3**: Use cloud first
- **Point 4**: Use open standards
- **Point 5**: Make things secure
- **Point 8**: Share, reuse and collaborate (use common platforms)
- **Point 9**: Integrate and adapt technology
- **Point 10**: Make better use of data

Councils adopting GDS Local platforms would naturally align with TCoP compliance, strengthening the value proposition.

### 5.6 Cyber Security Context

Several councils have suffered significant ransomware attacks in recent years:
- **Hackney London Borough**: Ransomware attack (October 2020) — services disrupted for months
- **Redcar and Cleveland**: Ransomware attack (February 2020) — estimated £11.3 million recovery cost
- **Birmingham City Council**: Multiple cyber incidents
- **Gloucester City Council**: Ransomware attack (December 2021)

The National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) has highlighted local government as a sector with variable security maturity. Shared, centrally maintained GDS platforms would likely provide better security assurance than most individually managed council systems.

---

## Part 6: Comparable Programmes

### 6.1 NHS Digital Shared Services (England)

NHS Digital (now NHS England Digital) provides shared digital infrastructure for the NHS:
- NHS Spine (national health record infrastructure)
- NHS App (patient-facing gateway to health services)
- NHS Login (authentication for NHS services)
- Shared data platforms

**Key lesson**: NHS Digital succeeded by providing genuinely useful shared infrastructure (Spine, NHS numbers, prescribing) at scale. NHS App grew to serve over 35 million registered users. The NHS has the advantage of a more unified governance structure than local government — all NHS trusts are ultimately accountable to NHS England, making mandation more feasible. GDS Local cannot mandate adoption, making the voluntary model more important.

### 6.2 Scotland — COSLA and NHS National Services Scotland

Scotland takes a different approach to England, with COSLA (Convention of Scottish Local Authorities) providing collective representation for Scotland's 32 councils. NHS National Services Scotland (NSS) provides shared services including digital infrastructure that can serve both NHS organisations and local authorities.

Key differences from GDS Local context:
- Scotland has 32 councils (vs. England's 317) — much more manageable to coordinate
- Stronger tradition of public sector shared services (shared services bodies well established)
- Scotland's CHI (Community Health Index) is being extended to local government for person identification — directly comparable to GDS Local's identity goals
- NHS Scotland's app being developed independently of England's NHS App (with explicit COSLA involvement)

**Implication**: Scotland's integration of health and local government identifiers provides a useful model for GDS Local's cross-service data sharing ambitions, particularly for housing-health use cases.

### 6.3 Wales — Centre for Digital Public Services (CDPS)

Wales has taken a more centralised approach than England to local government digital:
- **Centre for Digital Public Services**: Established to support Welsh public services with digital transformation capability
- **Chief Digital Officers**: Appointed for both the Welsh Government and local government
- **Digital Strategy for Wales**: Sets common standards for all Welsh public services including the 22 Welsh councils
- **Audit Wales review (August 2024)**: Found that Welsh local authorities are making progress on digital strategies but implementation remains uneven

Key differences:
- Wales has 22 councils (vs. England's 317) — fundamentally different scale challenge
- The CDPS model is closer to GDS Local than the NHS model — a central capability supporting a network of autonomous councils
- Welsh Government has stronger formal leverage over Welsh councils than UK Government has over English councils

**Implication**: The Welsh CDPS model — a small, expert team providing shared capability to autonomous councils — is the closest comparable internationally accessible model to what GDS Local is trying to achieve. Key learnings: (1) councils need active engagement not just platform provision; (2) different councils need different levels of support; (3) digital leadership capability in councils matters as much as technology.

### 6.4 International Comparisons

**Australia — myGov**:
Australia's myGov platform centralises access to federal government services (Medicare, Centrelink, ATO, etc.) but does not typically extend to state/territory/local government services. A more applicable Australian example is Service NSW, which provides a unified access point for NSW state government services — demonstrating that aggregation across different service domains is technically feasible.

**New Zealand — RealMe**:
New Zealand's RealMe system provides electronic registration and verified identity for citizens. It is used across central and local government services. New Zealand's smaller scale (5 million population, 67 territorial authorities) makes integration more tractable. RealMe is directly comparable to GOV.UK OneLogin and provides evidence that a single identity system can span central and local government tiers.

**Estonia — X-Road**:
Estonia's X-Road platform enables secure data exchange between public and private organisations. Over 900 organisations participate, exchanging data via standardised APIs. X-Road is the global benchmark for cross-government data sharing infrastructure and is directly relevant to GDS Local's data sharing platform ambitions. Estonia's key success factors: (1) legal obligation for all public sector organisations to use X-Road; (2) clear data ownership rules; (3) citizen visibility of every data access (akin to a consent/audit trail). GDS Local's data sharing governance dashboard is conceptually aligned with the X-Road citizen transparency model.

**Key ranking**: UK is ranked 7th globally for e-government (UN E-Government Survey 2024), behind Denmark, Estonia, Singapore, South Korea, Iceland, and Saudi Arabia. Bringing local government into the UK's digital infrastructure would contribute to improving this ranking.

## Part 7: Synthesis — Business Intelligence Insights for GDS Local

### 7.1 Favourable Conditions

| Condition | Evidence |
|-----------|---------|
| Political mandate | GDS Local announced November 2025 with ministerial commitment; named in Blueprint for Modern Digital Government |
| Council receptiveness | 300+ digital leaders engaged pre-launch; cost savings compelling given fiscal crisis |
| Existing platform adoption | Half of councils already use GOV.UK Notify — proven pathway for further adoption |
| Technology readiness | OneLogin discovery completed; MHCLG discovery underway; open standards (OIDC) widely supported |
| Market timing | Reorganisation creates new unitary authorities wanting modern digital infrastructure |
| Legal framework | Digital Economy Act 2017 provides data sharing gateways; ICO supportive of responsible innovation |

### 7.2 Significant Risks to Programme

| Risk | Evidence |
|------|---------|
| OneLogin timeline | Delivery slipped to 2028; councils already developing own solutions if GDS Local is too slow |
| Council capacity | Most councils are in fiscal crisis; IT teams are small and already overloaded |
| LGR disruption | Reorganisation absorbing council leadership attention; successor authorities may reset plans |
| Supplier resistance | Civica, Capita, NEC, Idox hold long-term contracts; may not support open API integration |
| Maturity gap | 47% of councils lack a published digital strategy; GDS Local assumes a digital capability baseline that many councils don't have |
| Scale of coordination | 317 councils is a very large number to coordinate voluntarily — Welsh model (22 councils) is much more tractable |

### 7.3 Strategic Implications

**Start with GOV.UK Notify as the on-ramp**: More than half of councils already use Notify. This existing community is the natural starting point for expanding GDS platform adoption. Councils using Notify are more digitally mature, more familiar with GDS, and more likely to see value in OneLogin and Pay.

**Address the capacity problem**: GDS Local cannot succeed if councils lack the capacity to engage. The programme needs to think carefully about how much support it provides to councils (funded onboarding, integration support) vs. how much it expects councils to self-serve. The Welsh CDPS model suggests a "capability building" component alongside platform provision.

**Position alongside, not against, suppliers**: The major suppliers (Civica et al.) have deep relationships with councils and understand local government domain complexity. A partnership approach — publishing open APIs and integration specifications, working with suppliers to integrate GDS platforms into their products — is more likely to succeed than attempting to displace suppliers.

**Data sharing governance is the hardest problem**: Cross-service data sharing requires legal frameworks (DSAs, DPIAs, lawful basis) that take time to establish. The ICO needs to be a partner, not an obstacle. The pilot approach (3 tightly scoped use cases in 10 councils) is well-designed to manage this risk.

**Reorganisation is an opportunity**: New unitary authorities being established in 2027-2028 are natural targets for GDS Local — they will be establishing new IT strategies without the legacy system commitments of predecessor councils.

## Requirements Traceability to Research

| Requirement | Research Finding | Implication |
|-------------|-----------------|-------------|
| BR-001: Extend GDS platforms to local authorities | 300+ councils already using Notify; OneLogin discovery complete; 14 councils, 8 suppliers surveyed | Supports phased approach; Notify adoption as on-ramp |
| BR-002: Cross-service data sharing | Digital Economy Act 2017 provides gateways; ICO supportive; no general power exists | Governance-first approach is correct; template DSAs essential |
| BR-003: £50M savings over 3 years | £5B annual spend; average 20% premium vs. collective purchase; direct spend £1.9B with large suppliers | Savings target is plausible if 100+ councils participate in purchasing |
| BR-004: Co-design with practitioners | 300+ digital leaders engaged; Future Councils Pilot shows need for co-design | Community of practice model validated; co-design before platform development |
| BR-006: Voluntary adoption | Local government autonomy is constitutional; LGA-mediated engagement required | Mandatory adoption is not viable; value demonstration is the only lever |
| NFR-P-002: Scale to 333 councils | England has 317 councils (not 333); LGR reducing number further | Architecture should be sized for 317 councils reducing to ~250 post-LGR |
| NFR-C-001: UK GDPR compliance | Data sharing legal framework complex; no general power; ICO sandbox available | ICO engagement essential from programme start |
