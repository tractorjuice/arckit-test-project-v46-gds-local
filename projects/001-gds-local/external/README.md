## Supported File Types
- PDF (.pdf)
- Word (.docx)
- Markdown (.md)
- Images (.png, .jpg) - for diagrams and screenshots
- CSV (.csv) - for data exports
- SQL (.sql) - for database schemas

## What to Put Here

## How It Works
ArcKit commands automatically scan this directory when generating artifacts.
External documents enhance output quality but are never blocking.
