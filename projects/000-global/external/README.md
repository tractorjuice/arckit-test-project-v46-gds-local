- Images (.png, .jpg) - for diagrams and screenshots

## What to Put Here
- Enterprise architecture blueprints and reference models
- Organization-wide technology standards documents

## How It Works
ArcKit commands automatically scan this directory alongside project-level
external documents when generating artifacts.
